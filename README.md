# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to build a simple component with an optimal layout depending on the user's device's screen size and enable hover states for all interactive elements

## How it went

I completed the challenge using some simple css and scss mixins. I don't think it's anything spectacular but if you're bored you may see the outcome [here](https://frontendmentor-3-column-preview-card-component-main-adammintaj.vercel.app/)
